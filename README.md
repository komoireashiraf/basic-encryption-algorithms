# Basic Encryption Algorithms
This repository contains Python implementations of basic encryption algorithms such as Caesar Cipher, RSA, and AES.

## Encryption Methods
- **Caesar Cipher**: A simple substitution cipher.
- **RSA**: Public-key cryptography algorithm for secure communication.
- **AES**: Advanced Encryption Standard for secure data encryption.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the desired folder and run the script:
   ```bash
   python3 encryption_algorithm.py
   ```

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: PyCryptodome (for AES)
